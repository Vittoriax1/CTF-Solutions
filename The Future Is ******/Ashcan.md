# Ashcan

An ashcan version of a comic book is a preliminary, often low-quality or limited-run publication created primarily to secure trademark or copyright rights for a title or character, rather than for commercial sale.
The term originated in the 1930s and 1940s during the early days of the comic book industry, when publishers rushed to claim popular-sounding titles before competitors could.
To legally prove a title had been published, they would produce a quick, inexpensive mock-up, typically the same size as a regular comic, often with a black and white cover made by pasting a new title onto recycled artwork from a previous issue.
Interior pages might contain unfinished pencil sketches, previously published material, or even be blank.
These editions were usually printed in very small quantities—sometimes as few as two copies—one sent to the US Patent & Trademark Office and the other kept on file.
The name "ashcan" reflects their intended fate: after fulfilling their legal purpose, they were often discarded in the trash.

To find the ashcan challenge, I found the copy in the Discord channel.

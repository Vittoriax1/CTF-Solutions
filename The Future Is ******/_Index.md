# The Future Is ******

This is a chronological listing of the different issues of _The Future is ******_, as well as my explanations to how I arrived at my solutions.

Note: Most of these are solved, but I need to complete the write-ups. Lesson to remember for the future is to write these up as I go, and not way after. Don't be lazy.

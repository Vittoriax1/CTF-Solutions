# OPGN - Issue 1

## Cover Challenge

### Description of Challenge

This challenge begins on the cover of the OGN issue.

In the bottom right corner, there is a cipger, which turns out to be a Pigpen cipher. It's very faint, yellow on a purple background.

Comparing the symbols to a random chart I found online, I was able to derive the first part of the challenge, the URL <a href="tficomic.io/bleeds">tficomic.io/bleeds</a>. Going to the site yields the bonus key, KEY{cefdff}. When entered into the platform, that yields **20** points. I was also redirected here: <a href="https://tficomic.io/ogn">tficomic.io/ogn</a>.  

Following the link brings me to a page with three different images and the following test:

> Hey there. Are you trying to crack the cover password?
> What happens when you mix colors?
> Try doing it with the images below:

The three images appear to be either numbers or letters if they were on a digital clock, and they are in three different colors. I downloaded each of the images and loaded them into GIMP. Playing around with layering and opacity yielded the cover word PLASMA, which resulted in **50** points.

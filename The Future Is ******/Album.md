# Album Cover

## Challenge 1 

### Description of Challenge

There was a reward as part of the Kickstart campaign. I did not get thir reward as I didn't have a way to be able to play it. Allegedly, there is a tficomio.io URL embedded somewhere on the album cover, but without the album, I am unsure of my success.

This will require some further thought and research. One of the Discord hints is: tone deaf.  So I don't believe that it is the music itself, but rather something is encoded within the notes.

### Solution

# Kickstarter Campaign 2

## Challenge 1

### Description of Challenge

Challenge 1 of the second Kickstarter Campaign gives us: 
> ROT13 GSVPBZVP.VB/S296N6NQ

Knowing that the challenges follow two formats, tficomic.io/ and mctf.io/, it isnt't difficult to see that this code also follows that same convention.  Using my favorite site, <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/en">DCode</a>, we pull up the decoder for ROT 13 and give it the ciphertext.  The site deciphers it to: TFICOMIC.IO/F296A6AD.  When we enter that URL, it gives us the BONUS key of F296A6AD. We enter that in the Problems area of the CTF platform and it awards us with **20** points. There is no additional challenge at that URL.

### Solution

TFICOMIC.IO/F296A6AD

## Challenge 2

### Description of Challenge

Challenge 2 of the second Kickstarter Campaign gives us

> HEX 5A2D3E4120677572786C6E72782E726C2F31363277787935770D0A

We feed it into DCode.fr and convert it from Hex to Ascii.  When doing this, it gives us: gurxlnrx.rl/162wxy5w. From there, we feed that ciphertext back into the Cipher identeifier tool, and it gives us many options.  After trying the first several, I was able to decrypt it using the Atbach cipher.  It gives me the URL: tficomic.io/162dcb5d. Going to that URL gives me the Bonus code of: 162dcb5d, which is worth **20** points.  There is no additional challenge at that URL.

### Solution

tficomic.io/162dcb5d

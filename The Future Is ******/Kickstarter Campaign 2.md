# Kickstarter Campaign 2

## Challenge 1

### Description of Challenge

Challenge 1 of the second Kickstarter Campaign gives us: CROT13 GSVPBZVP.VB/S296N6NQ. Knowing that the challenges follow two formats, tficomic.io/ and mctf.io/, it isnt't difficult to see that this code also follows that same convention.  Using my favorite site, <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/en">DCode</a>, we pull up the decoder for ROT 13 and give it the ciphertext.  The site deciphers it to: TFICOMIC.IO/F296A6AD.  When we enter that URL, it gives us the BONUS key of F296A6AD. We enter that in the Problems area of the CTF platform and it awards us with ** 20 ** points. There is no additional challenge at that URL.
